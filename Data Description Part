Data Description:
Foursquare API Data:
We will need to use the Foursquare locational data. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an 
area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the 
sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.

We will then find the list of venues in the city of Saratoga, CA and then pick out the Japanese restaurants.

We will need the following data:
1. Saratoga's Latitude and Longitude
2. Name of Venue(Japanese restaurants)
3. Rating of Japanese Restaurants
4. Wait time
5. Average price for a dinner
